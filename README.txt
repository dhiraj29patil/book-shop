                        Full-stack web application for a Book Store. 

The frontend, built using React, presented users with a visually appealing and responsive interface displaying books' images, titles, and authors, and enabled them to add new books via a user-friendly form. 

On the backend, I created a Node.js Express server with two API endpoints: one for adding new books, including image URLs, and another for fetching all stored books.

My choice of database, is MongoDB, facilitated efficient data storage. 

Throughout the development process, I have maintained clean, well-structured, and thoroughly documented code. This will aid in future maintenance and scalability of the application.

This project showcased my proficiency in modern web development technologies and my ability to create a user-friendly and functional application, emphasizing a clear separation between the frontend and backend for modularity and scalability.
